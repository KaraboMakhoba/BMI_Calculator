* Calculates the value of the weight and height entered by the user
* Displays the double bmi value and specifies the weight category
* The program asks the user if they want to calculate their BMI again.
* If Y the program runs again
* If N the program ends with a goodbye message. "Thank you for using the BMI Calculator"
